Excel Homework 
1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?


After analyzing the data per the instructions we can conclude:
1. Kickstarter campaigns can be successful.
2. Depending on the parent category can be highly successful. 
3. There is substantially more succesful campaigns in the parent fields of "Film & Video", "Music" and "Theater".  
4. Overall, 53% of campaigns were successful. 
5. The months of April-May are the highest in success rate. 

Limitations in the dataset: 
1. How were the different "states" marketed? This may give insights as to why others were more successful. 
2. 


Other graphs/Tables 
1. I would like to better understand the donation per backer amount and what would be driving higher donations. 
2. Success rate based on the beginning and end time stamps and how this may correlate into a more successfull campaign.
